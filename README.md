## About The Project

**Challenge 2: Innovating our communities**

Many technologies fail to prioritize or protect the unique needs of immigrants and underrepresented communities. Ice-Breakers seeks to bridge this gap by offering a tailored emergency support system that is multilingual, intuitive, and built with love.

Key features include:

- A panic button that notifies relatives and local rapid response networks  
- Automatic translation of emergency messages  
- A multilingual Red Card feature for use in interactions with authorities  
- Contact information for immigration support nearby using userâ€™s zip code  

### Built With

- React Native  
- Expo  
- Firebase Auth  
- Google Maps API
